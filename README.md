# 3. Set Up MongoDB Atlas

## Setting Up MongoDB Atlas and Remote Database Access

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up a MongoDB Atlas account and create a cluster for remote database access. MongoDB Atlas is a cloud-based database service that allows you to easily manage MongoDB databases.

## Create a MongoDB Atlas Account

1. Go to the MongoDB Atlas website: [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
2. Click the "Get started free" button.
3. Follow the registration process to create an account.

## Log in to Your MongoDB Atlas Account

Use the credentials you just created to log in to your MongoDB Atlas account.

## Create a New Project

After logging in, you will be prompted to create a new project. Projects help you organize your clusters and resources.

## Build a Cluster

1. In your project, click "Build a Cluster" to create a new cluster.
2. Configure your cluster by providing the following details:
   - Cluster Name: Choose a name for your cluster.
   - Cluster Tier: Select the cluster size (e.g., M0, M2, M10). The free M0 tier is suitable for testing and small projects.
   - Cloud Provider & Region: Choose a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) and region where your cluster will be hosted.
   - Additional Settings: Customize options like backups, automated scaling, and the version of MongoDB.

## Network Access

1. Under the Security section, configure your network access.
2. Whitelist your IP address or choose to allow access from anywhere (not recommended for production).
3. You can also configure IP Whitelist entries to include multiple IP addresses or CIDR ranges if needed.

## Database Access

1. Under the Security section, create a database user and set a secure password.
2. Assign appropriate permissions to the user based on your application's requirements.

## Review & Deploy

1. Review your cluster configuration, including the cluster name, size, region, and security settings.
2. Click the "Create Cluster" button to deploy your cluster.

## Wait for Cluster Creation

It may take a few minutes to create your cluster. You can monitor the progress on the MongoDB Atlas dashboard.

## Connect to Your Cluster

Once your cluster is created, you'll be able to connect to it. MongoDB Atlas provides a connection string that you can use in your application code. You can also download drivers and connect using a MongoDB client.

## Start Using Your Remote Database

Update your application's database connection settings with the connection string provided by MongoDB Atlas. Your remote MongoDB database is now ready to use!

Remember to configure your application to use the provided connection string and the credentials you created. Additionally, MongoDB Atlas offers many features for monitoring, scaling, and managing your database, so be sure to explore the dashboard for more options as you develop your project.


## 4. Start the Backend Server

- open the new terminal in vs code and go to you project directory
- ``cd your_project_location`` hit enter
- ``cd api`` and hit enter again
- now, youre ready to start your project backend partüöÄüòº
- ``yarn start`` hit enter and boom
- if you see below img you're done doing everything.real chad üòé
